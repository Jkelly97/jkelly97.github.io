## Introdution
Hi, my name is Justin Mackenzie Kelly.  My short term career goals are to become a succesful Java Developer and making my own Android application.  I believe I have what it takes to be a developer as I am very diligent and pideful in my work. This is a result of my work with Batesville Casket as a reapair man fixing damaged units to return to cusotmers for their loved ones.  I am also a quick learner who is unafriad to ask questions when I am stumped.
